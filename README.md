# Python for Genomic Data Science

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that analyzes genomic sequences, including:
- Finding Open Reading Frames (ORFs)
- Detecting repeated patterns in DNA sequences

## How to Use

Clone this repository and run the notebook in your Jupyter environment.

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Biopython
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

### Installation

Install the required packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genomic-data-science.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the notebook in Jupyter.
   ```
   cd notebooks/
   jupyter notebook Python_for_Genomic_Data_Science_Updated.ipynb
   ```

### Results

The notebook provides:
- The longest ORF in a given DNA sequence file.
- The most frequent repeated patterns in genomic sequences.

### Sample Data

If you wish to run the notebook with your own data, replace the input FASTA files with your own sequences.
